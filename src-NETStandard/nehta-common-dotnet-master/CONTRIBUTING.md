# How to contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

You can find out a bit more about this project by reading the [README](README.md)
file within this repository.

## Reporting issues

Issues can be used to:

* Report a defect
* Request a new feature or enhancement
* Ask a question

New issues will be automatically populated with a template that highlights the
information that needs to be submitted with an issue that describes a defect. If
the issue is not related to a defect, please just delete the template and
replace it with a detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve.

## Creating a pull request

New pull requests within this project's repository are pre-populated with a
checklist that describes the Definition of Done that we assess all new changes
against. It is ok to submit a pull request that has not yet addressed all of
these items, but be aware that the change will not be merged until it meets the
Definition of Done.

Please communicate with us (preferably through creation of an issue) before
embarking on any significant work within a pull request. This will prevent
situations where people are working at cross-purposes.
